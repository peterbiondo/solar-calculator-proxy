        Client is responsible for the completion of all payment plans associated with products they purchase. We reserve the right to seek recovery of any monies remaining unpaid via our Collection Agency.</p>

        <p><span class="section-heading">METHODS OF PAYMENT</span><br>
        We accept Visa, Mastercard, and American Express as a form of payment. If Client chooses to pay by monthly installments, he/she authorizes the monthly charge for the product on the Client's credit card or debit card.</p>

        <p><span class="section-heading">REFUNDS</span><br>
        You may request a full refund for our paid programs within 30 days of your original purchase by contacting our support team at <a href="mailto:Peter@isolarhotwater.com">Peter@isolarhotwater.com</a> and definitively requesting the full refund. We will NOT provide refunds after 30 days from the date of original purchase. On the 31st day, all payments are non-refundable and you are responsible for full payment of the fees for the product, regardless of whether or not you complete the program.</p>

        <p><strong>Please note:</strong> If you opted for a payment plan and you do not request a refund within 30 days, you are required by law to complete the remaining payments of your payment plan.

If you just downloaded the Training Material (PDFs, audios, videos, additional workbooks, and/or etc.), and then promptly asked for a refund, we reserve the right to deny your refund request. Why? Because the point of the policy is to give people the chance to try the system, and if it doesn't work, they can get their money back.
